# bigquery-github-repos-analysis

Inspired by this notebook on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/code/poonaml/analyzing-3-million-github-repos-using-bigquery/notebook

The original analysis on Kaggle was done over 5 years ago, and since then, the numbers, trends, and stats have changed. Beside the standard analyses, Iâ€™ve also included a few different calculations and visualizations. This repo is visualized here:[ https://lj6jui-ruddy-gunawan.shinyapps.io/github_repo_flexdashboard/](url)
